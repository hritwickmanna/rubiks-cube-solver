# 🚀 AlgoCubeSolver – Using Korf’s IDA* Algorithm

AlgoCubeSolver is a C++ project that efficiently models and solves a **3x3 Rubik’s Cube** using multiple search algorithms, achieving fast and optimal solutions. The solver effectively reduces solve times, achieving **sub-3-second** solutions for simpler scrambles and **under 10 seconds** for complex ones using **Korf’s IDA*** algorithm.

## 🧩 Algorithms

🔹 **BFS (Breadth-First Search)** – Explores cube states level-by-level for systematic solving.  
🔹 **DFS (Depth-First Search)** – Explores deep state branches sequentially.  
🔹 **IDDFS (Iterative Deepening DFS)** – Merges BFS completeness with DFS memory efficiency.  
🔹 **IDA*** (Iterative Deepening A* Search) – Uses heuristic-guided search for **faster, optimal solutions**, reducing search depth significantly.
